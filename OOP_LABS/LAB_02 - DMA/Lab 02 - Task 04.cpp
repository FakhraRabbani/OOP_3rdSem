// void getEvenOdd(const int ar[], const int n_ar, int* &even, int& n_even, int* &odd, int& n_odd);
// The parameters ptrArray and size holds starting address and the size of an array respectively.
// The function gets all the even and odd numbers from the array ar and place them into a newly created arrays pointed by parameter 
// even and odd respectively. Store the sizes of even and odd arrays into n_even and n_odd respectively. It should store 0 (zero) and

// Display appropriate message(s), if even and/or odd arrays are empty. Donâ€™t forget to free the memory resource allocated by the
